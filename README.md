# Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters

My continuation of [Combat Relief -- Crusade and Random Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/40)

## Download

I recommend using [Modfinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder/releases) to download WotR mods. 

But if you don't want to, here are the links for manual download (**Install only one, not both**):  
- ### Latest version. Requires [ModMenu](https://github.com/CasDragon/ModMenu/releases).  
[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/latest)

- ### Old version without ModMenu dependency   
In case you don't want to install ModMenu. Less functions, but deals with crusade the same.    
[**LINK**](https://github.com/alterasc/CombatRelief/releases/download/1.3.1/CombatRelief-1.3.1.zip)

## How to install:

1. Use Unity Mod Manager.
2. Remove 1.2.1 version of Combat Relief if you have it.
3. Install ModMenu.
4. Install this mod.

## Functionality

- ### Autowin of crusade battles  
Crusaders' armies always win autoresolve. Don't forget to enable crusade setting "Run the tactical combat automatically".

- ### Avoid random encounters   
Makes your party always avoid random encounters. Story encounters during travel are unaffected by the mod.

- ### Prevent Corruption  
When enabled corruption is not gained during rest.

- ### Skill roll modification (version 2.1.0+)
Allows to set on each skill if you want to roll normally/take 10/take 20.  
Can be set to work out of combat only.
Disabled by default.

- ### Teleport to skeleton mechant button (version 2.2.0+)
Teleports you to skeleton merchant random encounter area.
Has a check for game being main campaign, but other than that will teleport out of any situation and act. Don't use it to get there when you're not supposed to.   
So to be safe use it only when you're on global map.

## Settings

Any and all functions can be disabled in Options -> Mods -> CombatRelief. (Or in UMM if you're on version 1.3.1)    
By default all functions are enabled.   
Settings can be save-specific. Meaning if you change them in loaded game, that will affect only this save. If you change them while in Main Menu, that's sets default for all saves where they are not overwritten by save-specific settings.     
Settings affect game immediately, no restart is required.
